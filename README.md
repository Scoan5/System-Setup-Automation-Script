# Linux System-Setup-Automation-Script

 Automates initial Linux system setup on CentOS Stream 9 Distro: Creates a new user, installs packages, and applies system updates

# Overview 

 I created this project to display a way to create a new user and provide a foundation of packages and up to date files ready for use once the user log on. This reinforces safety practices for beginner or seasonal Linux users alike using CentOS 9 Stream Distro.

# Features

* Create a new user 
* Install new packages (ex: htop, wget, curl, etc.)
* Fundamental conditional statement (if/else)
* Bash script created for seamless workflow.

# Requirements / Prerequisites

* Must have a laptop/desktop
* Can be a standalone Linux computer or Virtual Machine (ex: Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation Player)
* CentOS 9 Stream Distro (Can use a different distro but users should be aware of potential variations in command syntax and available utilities when working with different distributions)

# Install / Run

```
Change the script into an executable file
chmod 777 setup.sh
```
```
Run the script 
./setup.sh
```

# Example & Media Ouput

Below are example visuals showing what happens when the automation script runs successfully on CentOS 9 Stream with the end result showing a new user with installed packages.


First I've created a new directory for the script to be in.
- [Directory created](screenshots/Create-Directory.png)

Then I've created the script name "setup.sh".
- [Created script](screenshots/Script-File-Created.png)

Changed modifications of the script to execute and ran the script.
- [Script running](screenshots/Execute-Script.png)

Login page on CentOS shows the new username.
- [New user login](screenshots/New-User-Created.png)

Checked for installed packages in the new users account terminal.

Below are the video demos showing the script "setup.sh" running in realtime.

# Future Updates

Here are other ways for me to update this project.

- Add new packages used for core responsibilities.
- Monthly version checks.
- Custom new username for user to create while running script.
- Alternate script for Debian-based users. (Ex: Ubuntu).
- Add more automation features based on real-world IT scenarios.
