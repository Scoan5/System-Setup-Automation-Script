# Linux System-Setup-Automation-Script

 Automates initial Linux system setup on CentOS Stream 9 Distro: Creates a new user, installs packages, and applies system updates

# Overview 

 I created this project to display a way to create a new user and provide a foundation of packages and up to date files ready for use once the user log on. This reinforces safety practices for beginner or seasonal Linux users alike using CentOS 9 Stream Distro.

# Features

* Create a new user 
* Install new packages (ex: htop, wget, curl, etc.)
* Fundamental conditional statement (if/else)
* Bash script created for seamless workflow.

# Requirements / Prerequisites

* Must have a laptop/desktop
* Can be a standalone Linux computer or Virtual Machine (ex: Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation Player)
* CentOS 9 Stream Distro (Can use a different distro but users should be aware of potential variations in command syntax and available utilities when working with different distributions)

# Install / Run

```
Change the script into an executable file
chmod 777 setup.sh
```
```
Run the script 
./setup.sh
```
